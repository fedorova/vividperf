This tool takes a file containing perf performance samples (e.g. perf.data), 
typically generated by 'perf record' and filters the samples to contain
only those occurring within the specified timestamps. It generates
the output file containing only the filtered samples. This new file is
still in valid perf format and can be processed by perf tools, such as
perf report. 

The motivation for this tool is if you have perf samples for a long-running program, but want to only examine the region of interest, to understand what
happened during a given time interval. 

Use the tool like this:

./perf-manicured -s <program_start_timestamp> -b <begin_timestamp> 
		 -e <end_timestamp>

For instance:

./perf-manicured -s 2689217978660222 -b 2689257902051738  
		 -e 2689257995783687   > $1.out


The provided timestamps must be obtained using clock_gettime with CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW as the clock type (or equivalent). 

It's a good idea to redirect the output produced by a tool to a file, as it will print some information about every sample it is processing. 

By default, the tool will work on the file perf.data located in the current directory and the "manicured" file will be named perf.data.manicured, but you can also specify an alternative input and output file names with the '-i' and '-o' options. For example:

./perf-manicured -i my-perf.data -o fitered-perf.data
